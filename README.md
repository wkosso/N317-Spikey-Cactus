## Site Description:

The About Saguaro Wildlife website is dedicated to sharing the history, mission, and core principles of the National Park Foundationâ€™s efforts to protect and enhance the national parks across America. As an official partner of the National Park Service, we aim to inspire stewardship, create impact through targeted initiatives, build strategic collaborations, and foster partnerships to preserve these treasured landscapes for future generations.

## Nested Route:

In this project, we implemented nested and sub-routes to organize the content efficiently. The About section has a main page (/about/principles/""), with sub-routes for Core Principles and a Feedback form, located in app/about/core-principles and app/about/feedback respectively. Similarly, the Homepage contains a main landing page to explore sub pages (explore/activites/""), with additional sub-routes for sections like Hiking Trails, Wildlife Spotting, and Guided Tours, which are stored in app/homepage/sections. These nested structures allow for modularity and easier management as the site scales, enabling clear content organization and seamless navigation between different sections and their corresponding details.
